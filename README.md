# Allexio's Create Plus 

A Create-centred modpack made for me and a bunch of friends (and friends' friends).

We started with a vanilla+ base with Create as a "central" mod and a bunch of performance / cosmetic / QoL mods without changing the content much (except for Create).

We then added a few vanilla-friendly content packs to keep the game fresh for returning players.

In the end this will be a vanilla++ Fabric modpack that satisfies most people who want more of the latest version of Minecraft & Create without adding anything that detracts from the original experience.

# Client setup

## Voice Chat
This is a voice chat enabled server, using the [Plasmo Voice](https://modrinth.com/plugin/plasmo-voice) mod (alongside its compatibility patch for Sound Physics Remastered).

The default option is voice activation. This can be changed by pressing the `#`(UK) / `\`(US) key and setting it up as you want.

By default there are two "ranges" of loudness for when you speak (think of it as screaming or whispering)
- 8 blocks (for whispering to someone without others hearing)
- 64 blocks (for talking to people comfortably on the server without having to stick to them like glue)

## Minimap

The minimap is disabled by default because I feel like it changes the vanilla game too much. You can still access the full map by pressing `M` and clients can re-enable the minimap individually.
