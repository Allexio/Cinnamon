# Allexio's Create Plus 

A Create-centred modpack made for me and a bunch of friends (and friends' friends).

We started with a vanilla+ base with Create as a "central" mod and a bunch of performance / cosmetic / QoL mods without changing the content much (except for Create).

We then added a few vanilla-friendly content packs to keep the game fresh for returning players.

In the end this will be a vanilla++ Fabric modpack that satisfies most people who want more of the latest version of Minecraft & Create without adding anything that detracts from the original experience.
